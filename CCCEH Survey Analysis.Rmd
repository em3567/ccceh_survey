## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r packages}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(labelled)

```
```{r import}
# import first data set
practice_data <- read.csv("Draft Responses2.csv")
view(practice_data)

# ESTABLISH CODEBOOK!

# get rid of first row of observations (the questions)
practice_data <- practice_data[-1,]
view(practice_data)

# add a column that indicates the source
practice_data <- practice_data %>% mutate(data_source = "YMCA")
glimpse(practice_data)

# import next data set (for now, I'll just re-import the same one)
practice_data2 <- read.csv("Draft Responses2.csv")
view(practice_data2)

# get rid of first row of observations (the questions)
practice_data2 <- practice_data2[-1,]
view(practice_data2)

# add a column that indicates the source (different from the first data set)
practice_data2 <- practice_data2 %>% mutate(data_source = "Scouts")
glimpse(practice_data2)

# Merge the data sets
all_practice_data <- rbind(practice_data, practice_data2)
view(all_practice_data)

```
```{r, motivation}

# Overall, what is the average score for this question?: For each child 12 and under, rate on a scale of 1-10 how much they wear children's makeup and body products as play versus for beautification?
